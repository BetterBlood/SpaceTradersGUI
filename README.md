# SpaceTraders

This is a GUI for SpaseTraders https://docs.spacetraders.io/
using pySimpleGUI
not finiched yet
not totaly usable yet


what is usable for the moment :
- creat an account (register)
- connect to an account with the token (login, with the token field filled)
- connect with the username (if register on the machin)
- when connected :
- - use the auto mode (for the moment it just buy a mining drone if no excavator in the fleet)
  
update to come : 
- a fully automatique mode (buy mining drone, go to mine point, excavate, sell cargo not in contract, if cargo full with contract needs go to contract point to sell cargo) and this until contract is fulfilled

good to know :
- if your token is not up to date, delete the "datas.json" file at the root of this program, and register again.
